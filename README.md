## Inspiration

Did you know that **263.16 billion pounds** of recyclable material are mis-sorted or not recovered every year in the U.S. alone? It's a staggering amount that highlights a major hurdle in our fight against climate change. We believe that empowering individuals with the right tools can make a monumental difference. That's why we created Verdaâ€”to transform confusion into clarity and enable everyone to be a part of the solution, right from their homes.

-----

## Social Impact

Verda drives **real behavioral change** by making environmental responsibility tangible. We raise awareness by helping users visualize their **carbon footprint** and **waste habits**. By tracking CO2 and waste, and providing **country-specific suggestions** for proper disposal and reduction, Verda helps users actively contribute to a greener planet.

-----

## How We Built It

To build Verda efficiently, we leveraged publicly available datasets and machine-learning models for the AI-powered trash sorter. We meticulously researched **20 countries' trash-sorting systems** to provide individualized guidance. **Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash model** powers our AI recommendations and complex CO2 emission calculations, handling parameters that simple formulas couldn't. The ranking system was developed using a robust **Supabase backend** for accurate tracking and display.

-----

## Challenges We Ran Into

Our most significant challenge was **setting up and managing the database** to handle the vast and varied information required for waste identification and precise, country-specific sorting rules. The diverse recycling guidelines across regions demanded extensive research and careful data structuring. We also dedicated considerable effort to designing an **intuitive UI/UX** that simplifies complex waste disposal decisions.

-----

## Accomplishments We're Proud Of

We are incredibly proud of Verda's **smooth styling and intuitive user interface**, which creates a seamless user experience. Getting the **backend to work efficiently and reliably** was a major accomplishment, ensuring our AI and data processing run smoothly. We are also thrilled with the **engaging and educational experience** provided by our AI-powered quizzes, which foster a deeper understanding of sustainable living.

-----

## What We Learned

Building Verda was a profound learning experience. We gained significant expertise in **backend development**, complex data structures, and seamless communication between components. We honed our skills in **version control** and deep-dived into **frontend styling** and **user-centered design**. We also mastered the intricacies of **deployment on domains**. Beyond technical skills, we learned extensively about global **waste statistics** and the diverse **waste sorting systems** in different countries.

-----

## What's Next for Verda

For Verda, we envision **integrating with hardware**, specifically smart bins already being deployed in some regions, for a more automated experience. Our next major goal is to **expand our database to include all countries worldwide**, solidifying Verda as a truly global solution for waste sorting. We're excited to continue empowering individuals to make a tangible difference in waste management and sustainability.
